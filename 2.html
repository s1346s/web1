<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
  CSS is constantly coming out with new versions. Introduced in 1996, CSS 1 became the basis for CSS. CSS 2.1 is the standard for CSS, and new features and tools are added compared to previous versions. The majority of web browsers support CSS 3. Currently, W3C makes CSS3 the standard.
  CSS has multiple levels and profiles. CSSs at each level typically contain new features and are divided into CSS1, CSS2, CSS3, and CSS4. Profiles are typically a subset of one or more levels of CSS created for a particular device or user interface. There are currently profiles for portable devices, printers and television receivers.
