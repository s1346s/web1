<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>
JavaScript (English: JavaScript) is an object-based script programming language. The language is mainly used within a web browser and has the ability to access embedded objects in other applications. It is also used in server programming, such as runtime environments such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by Brandan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name of Mocha at first, and later under the name of LiveScript, which eventually became JavaScript. Although JavaScript's java and syntax are similar, this is in fact because both languages are based on the basic syntax of C language, and JavaScript is not directly related. Except for names and phrases, there are more similarities to self or skim than Java.
